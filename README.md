# 🛡️ SOC Home Lab Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab setup designed to simulate real-world cyber attack scenarios and monitor them using SIEM tools. The lab environment helps in understanding log analysis, threat detection, and incident investigation.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Simulate attacks from an attacker machine
- Collect and monitor logs
- Detect suspicious activities using SIEM
- Perform basic incident analysis

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| Kali Linux | Attacker Machine |
| Splunk | Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) |
| Oracle VirtualBox | Hypervisor for creating virtual lab environment |
